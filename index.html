    Here are my top picks for travelers who want to discover beautiful destinations in the Philippines.<br>
    Let’s start off with the top destinations that are both exceptionally beautiful and easy to reach,<br>
     perfect for first-time visitors. Next, I’m going to share some spots that truly stand out from <br>

  <div class="flex-item-right"><p>Since the country is so spread out, <br>
    a trip to the Philippines requires careful planning so that<br>
     you can connect with the proper guides and find the most convenient<br>
     lodging as a base for your favorite activities. Some destinations<br>
     like the Chocolate Hills in Bohol or the Hanging Coffins in Sagada,<br>
      are remote, but getting there is well worth the effort.<br></p></div>
